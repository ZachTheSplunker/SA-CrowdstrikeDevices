## Known issues

Issue | Description | Solution | GitHub issue reference
----- | ----------- | -------- | ----------------------
Lookup file error | You may see the error `status="Lookup file error, unknown path or update time" name=crowdstrike_devices` | This error exists since the KVstore is being used opposed to a csv file and does not interfere with the functionality of lookup creation. | Issue [#22](https://github.com/ZachChristensen28/SA-CrowdstrikeDevices/issues/22)
